 ofxTriangleMesh by zach lieberman
 
 based off of 

 ofxTriangle by kikko.fr
 Point inside polygon by Theo / paul bourke
 

 this code uses the original triangle (not triangle++) to allow for switches like 
 q33 a100, etc 
 
 https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.switch.html
 
 there are options that allow for the addition of new points to make a much nicer mesh, 
 triangle++ had that turned off and a heavily modified version of triangle, 
 so this is using the original triangle library and allows for some control of parameters
